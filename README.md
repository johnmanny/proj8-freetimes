Displaying freetimes from google calendars

## Description:

***Revision Author:*** John Nemeth

***Sources:*** Previous projects, class material, API documentation 
and example code.

***Functionality:*** A date/time range must first be chosen. Then, the calendars desired.
A column space will display with events and freetimes listed in chronological order beginning 
and ending based on the time range chosen. The ranges only need to be chosen once. Selecting 
other calendars will change the events displayed. Some test cases are included in the tests
directory.
